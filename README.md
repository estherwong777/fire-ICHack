# :fire: Fire :fire: - A 2D voice-controlled game on Android

## Design

* Player is positioned at the bottom of the screen and fireballs come down from the top of the screen. The aim is to not let the fireballs touch the bottom of the screen.
* Player can fire bullets to extinguish the fireballs by saying "Fire!" into the microphone
* Maximum bullets that the player can have on the screen is 5
* Points are added as fireballs are extinguished, and level increases as time passes so fireballs approach faster and more often
