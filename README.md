# :fire: Fire :fire: - A 2D voice-controlled game on Android

## Design

* Player is positioned at the bottom of the screen and Dummies come down from the top of the screen. The aim is to not let the Dummies touch the bottom of the screen.
* Player can shoot fireballs to kill the Dummies by saying "Fire!" into the microphone
* Maximum fireballs that the player can have on the screen is 5
* Points are added as Dummies are killed, and level increases as time passes so Dummies approach faster and more often
